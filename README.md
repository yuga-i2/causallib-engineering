# CausalLib – Production-Grade Causal Inference in Python

CausalLib is a Python library for estimating causal treatment effects from observational data using well-established causal inference methods.  
It provides a consistent API, diagnostics for validating assumptions, and evaluation utilities to support reliable causal analysis in production and research workflows.

The library emphasizes transparency, correctness, and debuggability, making causal reasoning explicit rather than hidden behind black-box estimators.

---

## Overview

CausalLib supports causal effect estimation using multiple approaches, enabling practitioners to compare methods, validate assumptions, and understand trade-offs when working with non-experimental data.

Supported estimators include:

- Inverse Probability Weighting (IPW)
- Matching
- Standardization
- Augmented IPW (AIPW)
- R-Learner
- X-Learner
- Targeted Maximum Likelihood Estimation (TMLE)
- Overlap Weights

The system is designed to work with user-provided machine learning models and integrates naturally with the scikit-learn ecosystem.

## Key Capabilities

- Multiple causal estimators under a unified API  
- Diagnostics for overlap, propensity scores, and covariate balance  
- Clear validation and error handling for common causal pitfalls  
- Estimator comparison to assess robustness of results  
- Support for heterogeneous and stratified treatment effects  
- Extensive unit test coverage for core functionality and edge cases  

---

## Design Principles

- Explicit assumptions: causal validity is checked, not assumed  
- Interpretability first: prioritizes clarity over black-box automation  
- Modular architecture: estimation, validation, and diagnostics are separated  
- User control: model choice and tuning remain explicit  
- Production-aware: clear errors, predictable behavior, tested paths

## Installation

```bash
pip install causallib
```

---

## Quick Example

```python
from causallib.estimation import IPW
from causallib.datasets import load_nhefs
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression

X, treatment, outcome = load_nhefs()

estimator = IPW(propensity_estimator=LogisticRegression())
estimator.fit(X, treatment)

ate = estimator.estimate_ate(X, treatment, outcome)
print(ate)
```

---

## Diagnostics Example

```python
from causallib.diagnostics import PropensityScoreStats

stats = PropensityScoreStats(estimator=estimator)
report = stats.report(X, treatment)
print(report)
```
